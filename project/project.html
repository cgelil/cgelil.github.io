            <h1>Hunger, Conflict and Displacement in Sudan</h1>
            <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This project aims to examine the ongoing food crisis in Sudan, 
                with a focus on two key drivers - conflict and internal displacement -
                and their relationship with food insecurity.
                Specifically, I investigate the period following the outbreak of the civil war in April 2023,
                analyzing the consequences at a subnational level.

            <p> Sudan has been experiencing worsening levels of acute food security since 2021. 
                By May 2024, over half of the Sudanese population (25.6 Million) was facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). 
                First projections for 2025 show 5 areas being fully classified in  catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity (IPC 5).

            <p> This does not come as a surprise considering Sudan's timeline of political instability.
                In October 2021, the Sudanese military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, seized control of the government in a coup, 
                dissolving the civilian governmen and triggering widespread protests. This continues until April 2023 when a civil war erupted 
                between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF),resulting in significant fatalaties.

        <p> <strong>Conclusions:</strong> <br>


        <div class="writeup">
            <p> <strong>Data:</strong> <br>
                <li>HDX data</li> I used the HDX Humanitarian API (HAPI) to download datasets provided from the IOM and IPC
                <li> <strong>IPC Food Security data:</strong></li> 
                Using a Python script I first request a list of IPC analyses using the IPCs API, filtering for current data. 
                For each analysis, the script downloads the associated geographic data in GeoJSON format using a second API. If the analysis
                does not contain current data, the script requests projection data using a third API. The data includes the IPC color scale.
                <li> <strong> ACLED Events data:</strong></li> Since HDX does not include all event types in their data, I reverted to ACLED.
                ACLED's API has a bandwidth limit that prevents users from retrieving larger 
                amounts of data in a single call. Instead, ACLED data export tool allows a simple and fast option to download the data in one call.
                The dataset contained 17.035 single event observations, which I grouped by month and removed irrelevant event types in order
                to create a cleaner dataset.

            </p>
            <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> <br>
                I wanted to achieve more interactive animation and customization for the plots, so I used d3.js to create the plots. 
                The level of customization, especially in relation to the sizes was quite challenging, so I utilized AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT)
                to aid with the generation of the plots.<br>
                For the map, I was able to include controls for animating the map updates with a slider and play/pause button, 
                allowing users to view changes over time. I also was able to render more easily both the polygons and the point geometries
                to show areas and IDPs/Refugee areas.<br>

                Secondly, when I was creating the scatterplots, I faced challenges matching the list of over 100 admin2 area names which
                were not equivalent across sources. For that, I used the python package fuzzywords to create a mapping dictionary based on 
                word similarity.
