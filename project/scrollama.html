            <p>A civil war between two major rival factions of the military government of Sudan, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 
                under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and its allies (collectively the Janjaweed coalition) 
                under the Janjaweed leader Hemedti, began during Ramadan on 15 April 2023.[22] 
                Three minor (neutral) factions have also participated in the fighting: the Darfur Joint Protection Force; the SLM (al-Nur) under Abdul Wahid al-Nur; and the SPLM-N under Abdelaziz al-Hilu. 
                Fighting has been concentrated around the capital city of Khartoum (the largest and initial battle of the war) and the Darfur region.[23][24]
                As of 14 November 2024, at least 61,000 people had been killed in Khartoum State alone, of which 26,000 were a direct result of the violence.[18] 
                As of 5 July 2024, over 7.7 million were internally displaced and more than 2.1 million others had fled the country as refugees,[20][21] 
                and many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres.

            <h1>Impact on Food Security</h1>
            <p>The latest projection update of Sudan reveals that
                intense conflict and organized violence, coupled with the
                continued economic decline, have driven approximately
                17.7 million people across Sudan (37 percent of the
                analysed population) into high levels of acute food
                insecurity, classified in IPC Phase 3 or above (Crisis or
                worse) between October 2023 and February 2024. Of
                those, about 4.9 million (10 percent of the population
                analysed) are in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and almost 12.8
                million people (27 percent of the population analysed)
                are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis).
