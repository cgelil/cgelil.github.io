            <h1>Understanding the drivers of food insecurity in Sudan</h1>
            <p>This project explores the causes and consequences of the ongoing food crisis in Sudan, 
                which has been aggravated since the beginning of the civil war in April 2023. 
                The focus is on 3 key drivers: conflict and insecurity, displacement, and economic shocks.

                 with 755,000 at risk of famine across 10 states. Additionally, at least 534,000 IDPs and refugees were facing critical or
                  catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 4 or 5).</p>
