                    When you are happy with the charts, take the json code that generates them, and save this as two new .json files in your GitHub repo.
                    Now embed these two charts in your page.

                    <li>Produce two charts that support or refute (or are related to in some way) a topic discussed at the Festival of Economics.

                    <li>Set out (not more than 25 words) a topic that was discussed.
                        • Make two charts that support or refute it or a related to an argument on this topic. This could be two that support, two that refute, or a mixture.
                        • Comment (not more than 25 words) on what you find. Your commentary should be placed near the chart in a way that makes it intuitive to your site’s users (i.e., above, below, or to the side).</li>

                <p>
                    <strong>Chosen Topic:</strong> Housing affordability and vacancy rates challenge the new government’s goal of making housing more accessible and affordable for UK residents.

                    <li>The UK has a relatively low vacancy rate compared to other OECD nations, suggesting limited availability may contribute to higher rental prices.</li>

    <h2> Coding Challenge 4: Replication. Re-create, then improve, someone else’s chart.</h2>
    <p>Find a chart that a journalist, think tank, television channel or company has used. Your challenge this week is to replicate it, and then improve on it. Refer back to our discussion of the do’s and don’ts of visualisation for guidance.</p>
    <p> find something from https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/</p>

    <h2> Coding Challenge 5: Scraper. Implement a data scraper of your own.</h2>
    <p>This week we have discussed the simple ways of scraping data from websites. Using a Google Colab python notebook, scrape a website through one of the presented methods in class (pandas read_html or beautifulsoup). This can be any source, any data.
        Then clean and normalise the data and export into TIDY (long form) format.</p>
    <p> 1. A link to the Google Collab python notebook where you conducted your data analysis (make sure you make it publicly accessible!)
        2. A chart built with the data from the previous point. It is up to you what how do you reference and include the data in the Vega-lite chart specification.
        3. Comment (not more than 25 words) why did you choose this site.</p>
