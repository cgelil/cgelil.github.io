            <h1>Hunger, Conflict and Displacement in Sudan</h1>
            <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This project aims to examine the ongoing food crisis in Sudan, 
                with a focus on two key drivers - conflict and internal displacement -
                and their relationship with food insecurity.
                Specifically, I investigate the period following the outbreak of the civil war in April 2023,
                analysing the consequences at a subnational level.

            <p> Sudan has been experiencing worsening levels of acute food security since 2021. 
                By May 2024, over half of the Sudanese population (25.6 Million) was facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). 
                First projections for 2025 show 5 areas being fully classified in  catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity (IPC 5) by the end of 2025.

            <p> This does not come as a surprise considering Sudan's timeline of political instability.
                In October 2021, the Sudanese military seized control of the government in a coup, 
                dissolving the civilian government and triggering widespread protests. In April 2023, a civil war erupted 
                between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF),resulting in significant fatalities.

            <p>To understand how the conflict has affected the deterioting state of food insecurity,
            we can look at the latest IPC data and examine the relationship with 
            the number of IDPS and the number of Incidents.

                <strong>Conclusions:</strong> The Sudanese civil war has significantly exacerbated food insecurity across the country. 
                Areas experiencing high levels of violence show a strong positive correlation (0.65 at the Admin 1 level)
                 with the population in IPC Phase 3+, indicating severe food insecurity.
                  However, the correlation with the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is notably weaker. 
                This weaker relationship is largely influenced by Khartoum, the epicenter of the conflict, 
                which has a relatively low number of IDPs. Paradoxically, while Khartoum has fewer displaced individuals,
                 it remains the primary area of displacement for many IDPs across the country.
                 Further analysis could look into the relationship based on the area of origin of IDPs, although as of now
                 the IOM has this data available on an Admin1 level.

            <h2><strong>Data sources:</strong></h2>
            
            <p> <strong>Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX): </strong>
                My starting point was the HDX since it provides direct access to a wide variety of sources from different international organizations.
                I set up a loop to download all the Bi-Weekly updates from the IOM on displacement, and all the IPC data for Admin levels 1 and 2.
                I then reshaped and cleaned the data, adjusting data to get it in a useable format for analysis.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC):</strong>
                Using another loop and the IPCs API, I first request a list of IPC analyses using, filtering for current data. 
                For each analysis, the script downloads the associated geographic data in GeoJSON format using a second API. If the analysis
                does not contain current data, the script requests projection data using a third API.
            </p>

            <p> <strong> Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED):</strong>
                Since HDX does not include all event types in their data, I reverted to ACLED.
                ACLED's API has a bandwidth limit that prevents users from retrieving larger 
                amounts of data in a single call. Instead, ACLED data export tool allows a simple and fast option to download the data in one API call.
                The dataset contained 17.035 single event observations, which I grouped by month and removed irrelevant event types in order
                to create a cleaner dataset. 
            </p>

            <p> <strong> IOM Internal Displacemnet Matrix:</strong>
                I used the IOM's API to download all their country data, and then filtered it to include the top 10 countries.
            </p>

                

            <h2> <strong>Challenges:</strong> <br></h2>
            <p> 
                I wanted to create more interactive animation and customization for the plots, so I used d3.js to create the plots. 
                The level of customization, especially in relation to sizing ,
                was quite challenging, so I utilized AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT)
                to aid with the generation of the plots.<br>
            </p>
                For the map, I was able to include controls for animating the map updates, allowing users to view changes over time. I also was able to render more easily both the polygons and the point geometries
                to show areas and IDPs/Refugee areas.<br>
            <p>
                Secondly, when I was creating the scatterplots, I faced challenges matching the list of over 100 admin2 area names which
                were not equivalent across sources. For that, I used the python package fuzzywords to create a mapping dictionary based on 
                word similarity. 
            </p>
